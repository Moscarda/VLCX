# VLCX

VLCX is basically QuickTime Player, but with libvlc as a backend. The interface aims to be pretty much identical to QuickTime's, but there's still a lot to do to get there.

## Using

If you just want to use VLCX, [download the latest release here](https://github.com/insidegui/VLCX/releases/VLCX_latest.zip). The release available on GitHub is not codesigned, so you will have to allow It to run by going to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Allow apps downloaded from:` and selecting `Anywhere`.

## Dependencies

VLCX requires a copy of VLCKit.framework, you can get It [here](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLCKit/).
